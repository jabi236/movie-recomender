All you need to do to start this is run each code block in order, it will take some time to load in all the data into the project so be patient.

To test different movies, change the movie title within the test reccomender function calls(collab_reccomender() and content reccomendr()). You may need to look within the dataset to find the correct format for the title.

Datasets I used are provided below. You will need to download them to run the code. You may need to change the file paths from the reading in the data portion of the project to read in the data correctly.
